Significant changes to the "ore" package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.5

- Calculation of match offsets within the C code have been made much more
  efficient.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.4

- Default methods have been added for matches() and groups(), which return NA.
- The "rex" test is now skipped if that package is not available.
- Various low-level warnings/errors from UBSAN have been addressed.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.3

- Almost all of the work of ore.search() is now done in C code rather than R,
  for performance. In testing, ore is now appreciably faster than base R for
  simple searches, when the regex is precompiled. Optimisation of other
  functions will follow in later releases.
- The package no longer requires any specified minimum version of R (although
  it has not been tested on old releases).

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.2

- A bug in the ore.subst() function that could produce low-level errors or
  segmentation faults has been fixed.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.1

- Tests should no longer fail in locales which do not use a UTF-8 encoding.
- Documentation tweaks.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- First public release.
